This folder contains the scripts to perform the paper experiments, and is organized in two folders:

* setup: contains one script per case study that generates all the required trace files. 

* fuzz: contains one script per case study that will perform the fuzzing step

For instance, to perform the analysis for the List case study, run:

`./experiments/setup/list-setup.sh`
